A wrapper for the [Approov SDK](https://github.com/approov/approov-android-sdk) to enable easy integration when using [`Java GRPC`](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java) on Android for making API calls that you wish to protect with Approov. In order to use this you will need a trial or paid [Approov](https://www.approov.io) account.
